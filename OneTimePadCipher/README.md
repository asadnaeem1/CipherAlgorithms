# One Time Pad Cipher
## BSCS-631 Network Security & Cryptography
Implementation of One Time Pad Cipher.

Language: C#

The Input to the program should be binary.

In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.
